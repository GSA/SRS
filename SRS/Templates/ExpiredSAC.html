   <p> <b>ATTENTION:</b> [LAST NAME] [SUFFIX], [FIRST NAME] [MIDDLE NAME] SAC Expiration [CURRENT DATE]<br /> </p>

    <h1>Hello,</h1>
    <br />
    <p>This email is to inform you that the Special Agreement Check (SAC) granted on [SAC DATE] for
     [FIRST NAME] [MIDDLE NAME] [LAST NAME] [SUFFIX] expires today. Please ensure
    the individual is no longer working on a GSA contract after today.</p>

    <p>If the contractor’s support on a GSA contract is needed beyond the SAC expiration date,
    the individual will need to complete a new background investigation. Do not allow
    them to continue work until another favorable determination has been provided.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Thank you,</p>

    <p>HSPD-12 Security</p>
